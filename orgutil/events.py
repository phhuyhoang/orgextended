    A self-operating event mechanism runs in a separate thread,

    something to call .emit() or .notify() to inform listeners, it takes 
    in callbacks as event conditions to actively check them in an event 
    loop. Whenever a condition is satisfied, the event will be triggered, 
    and listener callbacks will be invoked.\n
    Notice: Each time you initialize a new EventLoop instance, it will
    create an additional thread to run in. If you have basic needs,

    This code is extremely rudimentary and hasn't been thoroughly tested 
    in all the cases. I'm only using it for very specific functionalities. 
    Use it at your own risk.\n

    Considerations when using:\n
    * If one of the event handlers is extremely costly or never completes, 
      it will block all subsequent event handlers of the same event. 
      All efforts to listen to that event will be considered impossible 
      from that point onwards.
    * Although the handlers list of each event runs in a fork thread, 
      the condition checking will be handled in the root thread. 
      Therefore, be aware that blocking the event condition checking 
      will also block the entire event loop. Ideally, the event condition 
      should be a function with minimal processing overhead.
